# Automate-Spotify-Playlists-In-Python
In this session, we’ll show you how to sync up your YouTube and Spotify playlists automatically.  We’ll do this by using both the YouTube and Spotify APIs through Python with an assist from the open source YouTube_dl tool.  Our solution will iterate through entries in our existing YouTube playlist, parse the data into song and artist name for each, run a background search on Spotify for the same, and create a new Spotify playlist with the same tracks for us to listen to - seamlessly replicating from one platform to the other at the click of a button.  

Prerequisites: 
✅ Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
✅ PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or any other code editor for Python
